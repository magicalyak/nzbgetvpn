# Security Status Report - rocky.gamull.com NZBGet Container

## Current Security Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL PROTECTION

### ✅ Working Security Features:

1. **VPN Connection Active**
   - Interface: tun0 (172.21.33.5/23)
   - External IP: 45.38.16.49 (VPN provider)
   - Your real IP (65.43.84.100) is hidden

2. **Basic Firewall Rules**
   - INPUT: DROP (default policy active)
   - FORWARD: DROP (default policy active)
   - OUTPUT: ACCEPT with eth0 DROP rule
   - eth0 traffic blocked (148 packets dropped)

3. **Service Running Properly**
   - NZBGet: Running
   - OpenVPN: Running
   - Container: Healthy status

### ⚠️ Missing Enhanced Security Features:

1. **No DNS Leak Prevention**
   - No specific rules blocking DNS on eth0
   - DNS queries could potentially leak

2. **No VPN Monitor Service**
   - No active monitoring to stop NZBGet if VPN fails
   - NZBGet would continue running if VPN drops

3. **OUTPUT Policy Not Strict**
   - OUTPUT default is ACCEPT (should be DROP for strict killswitch)
   - Less restrictive than recommended configuration

## Safe Verification Tests (No Service Disruption)

### Test 1: VPN Traffic Routing ✅
```bash
Container IP: 45.38.16.49 (VPN)
Host IP: 65.43.84.100 (Real)
Result: Traffic properly routed through VPN
```

### Test 2: Firewall Rules ⚠️
```bash
INPUT: DROP ✅
FORWARD: DROP ✅
OUTPUT: ACCEPT (should be DROP) ⚠️
eth0 blocking: Partial ✅
```

### Test 3: DNS Configuration ⚠️
```bash
DNS Server: 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
DNS through VPN: Yes ✅
DNS leak prevention rules: Not found ⚠️
```

## Recommendations (Without Disrupting Service)

To add the enhanced security features from the PR without disrupting your current service:

1. **Wait for next maintenance window**
2. **Update container image to include new features**
3. **Add environment variables to enable monitoring:**
   ```bash
   VPN_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
   VPN_MAX_FAILURES=3
   AUTO_RESTART_VPN=true
   ```

## Current Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: VPN is active and working
- **Medium Risk**: No automatic protection if VPN fails
- **Mitigation**: Manual monitoring recommended until upgrade

Your current setup provides good basic protection, but lacks the enhanced kill switch features that would automatically stop NZBGet if the VPN fails.
