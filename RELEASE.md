# nzbgetvpn Release Notes

## v25.0.28 (2024-12-19)
**Fix: Monitoring Port Access**

### üîß Critical Fix
- **Added missing monitoring INPUT rule**: VPN setup script now includes `iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT`
- **External monitoring access**: Monitoring endpoint now accessible from outside container without manual intervention
- **Out-of-the-box functionality**: No more need for manual firewall rule additions after deployment

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability  
- **Maintains VPN security**: Only adds necessary rule for monitoring port 8080
- **Consistent with other ports**: Follows same pattern as NZBGet UI (6789) and Privoxy (8118) rules
- **Automatic application**: Rule applied during VPN setup, no user intervention required

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Resolves monitoring access issues**: External health checks and dashboards now work immediately
- **Eliminates manual fixes**: No more need to manually add iptables INPUT rules
- **Consistent container behavior**: All exposed ports now properly accessible

### üìã Technical Details
The monitoring port (8080) was missing an INPUT iptables rule, causing external access to be blocked even though the port was exposed. The VPN setup script already included INPUT rules for:
- Port 6789 (NZBGet UI) ‚úÖ
- Port 8118 (Privoxy) ‚úÖ
- Port 8080 (Monitoring) ‚ùå **[NOW FIXED]**

This release adds the missing rule to ensure consistency and immediate functionality.

## v25.0.27 (2025-06-13)
**Fix: VPN Kill Switch Chicken-and-Egg Problem**

### üîß Critical Fix
- **Fixed VPN connection failure**: Resolved the chicken-and-egg problem where the VPN kill switch blocked the UDP traffic needed to establish the VPN connection
- **Smart kill switch logic**: Now extracts VPN server details from OpenVPN config and allows connectivity to VPN server before applying traffic blocking rules
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects and allows traffic to the specific VPN server IP and port from the config file
- **Multi-protocol support**: Handles both UDP and TCP VPN connections
- **WireGuard support**: Includes exception for standard WireGuard port (51820/udp)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability
- **Maintains security**: Kill switch still blocks all non-VPN traffic, preventing IP leaks
- **Graceful fallbacks**: If server detection fails, adds exceptions for common VPN ports (1194)
- **DNS resolution**: Resolves VPN hostnames to IP addresses for precise firewall rules

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Resolves monitoring "unhealthy" status**: VPN can now connect properly, allowing health monitoring to show correct status
- **Eliminates container startup failures**: No more VPN connection timeouts during container startup
- **Fixes transmission UDP blocking**: Resolves similar issues affecting other VPN-enabled containers

### üìã Technical Details
The root cause was that the VPN kill switch (`iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -j DROP`) was blocking ALL outbound traffic on eth0, including the UDP packets needed for OpenVPN to connect to the VPN server. This created a circular dependency:
1. Kill switch blocks UDP ‚Üí VPN can't connect
2. VPN can't connect ‚Üí tun0 interface never created  
3. No tun0 ‚Üí traffic remains blocked by kill switch

The fix adds a specific exception rule (`iptables -A OUTPUT -d $VPN_SERVER_IP -p udp --dport $VPN_SERVER_PORT -j ACCEPT`) before the DROP rule.

### üîÑ Upgrade Path
- **Automatic**: Existing containers will get the fix on restart
- **No configuration changes required**
- **Maintains compatibility**: All existing VPN configs continue to work

## v25.0.26 (2025-06-13)

# Release Instructions - Fixed Version with Monitoring

This document outlines the process for creating and releasing the fixed version of nzbgetvpn with BusyBox compatibility and enhanced monitoring.

## What's Fixed in This Release

### ‚úÖ BusyBox Compatibility
- **Fixed health check script** - Replaced `grep -oP` with BusyBox-compatible sed commands
- **IP address extraction** - Now works reliably across all Linux distributions
- **Monitoring status** - Individual service checks now report correctly

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Monitoring
- **Prometheus metrics** - Full integration with /prometheus endpoint
- **Health endpoints** - Comprehensive status reporting
- **Auto-restart capabilities** - Service recovery and notifications
- **Docker device mapping** - Proper /dev/net/tun configuration

### ‚úÖ Documentation Updates
- **Monitoring guide** - Complete MONITORING.md documentation
- **Docker Compose** - Updated with device mapping requirements
- **Troubleshooting** - BusyBox-specific solutions
