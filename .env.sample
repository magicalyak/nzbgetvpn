# .env.sample - Example configuration for nzbgetvpn
# Copy this to .env and customize for your setup.

# ---- VPN Client Settings ----
# VPN_CLIENT: 'openvpn' or 'wireguard'
VPN_CLIENT=openvpn

# VPN_CONFIG: Path *inside the container* to your VPN configuration file.
# For OpenVPN: e.g., /config/openvpn/your_provider.ovpn
# For WireGuard: e.g., /config/wireguard/wg0.conf
# If unset, the script will try to use the first .ovpn or .conf file found in the
# respective /config/openvpn or /config/wireguard directory.
VPN_CONFIG=

# ---- OpenVPN Specific Credentials ----
# There are two ways to provide OpenVPN credentials if your .ovpn file requires them
# (e.g., it contains `auth-user-pass` without a specific file path, or just `auth-user-pass`).

# Option 1: Use Environment Variables (Recommended if not using a file)
# These are used if both VPN_USER and VPN_PASS are set and not empty.
VPN_USER=
VPN_PASS=

# Option 2: Use a Credentials File at a Fixed Location
# If VPN_USER and VPN_PASS are NOT set (or one/both are empty), the script will
# automatically look for a credentials file at the fixed path inside the container:
#   /config/openvpn/credentials.txt
# This file must contain your username on the first line and your password on the second line.
# To use this method:
#   1. Create a text file (e.g., `my_vpn_auth.txt` or simply `credentials.txt`) on your host system.
#   2. Add your VPN username to the first line.
#   3. Add your VPN password to the second line.
#   4. Ensure this file is mounted into the container at `/config/openvpn/credentials.txt`.
#      For example, if you map your host directory `/opt/nzbgetvpn_data/config` to `/config`
#      in the container, you would place your credentials file on the host at
#      `/opt/nzbgetvpn_data/config/openvpn/credentials.txt`.
# (The old VPN_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable is no longer used.)

# ---- General Settings ----
# ENABLE_PRIVOXY: 'yes' or 'no' to enable/disable Privoxy HTTP proxy (also uses VPN)
ENABLE_PRIVOXY=no

# ENABLE_EXPORTER: 'yes' or 'no' to enable/disable the Prometheus metrics exporter.
# If 'yes', metrics will be available at http://<container_ip>:9452/metrics
ENABLE_EXPORTER=no

# PRIVOXY_PORT: Port Privoxy will listen on *inside* the container.
# The Docker -p mapping will expose this to your host.
PRIVOXY_PORT=8118

# PUID & PGID: User and Group ID for NZBGet and related processes.
# Set these to match the owner of your host's /config and /downloads directories
# to avoid permission issues. Find yours with `id yourusername` on your host.
PUID=1000
PGID=1000

# TZ: Your local timezone, e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London
# See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
TZ=Etc/UTC

# LAN_NETWORK: Your LAN network in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
# Allows NZBGet/Privoxy access from your LAN, bypassing the VPN for these local connections.
LAN_NETWORK=

# NAME_SERVERS: Comma-separated list of DNS servers to be used by the container.
# If not set, DNS servers from the VPN or system defaults will be used.
# Example: 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
NAME_SERVERS=

# DEBUG: 'true' or 'false'. Enables verbose logging for VPN setup scripts.
DEBUG=false

# VPN_OPTIONS: Additional command-line options for the OpenVPN client.
# Example: --inactive 3600 --ping-restart 60
VPN_OPTIONS=

# UMASK: File creation mask for NZBGet.
UMASK=022

# ADDITIONAL_PORTS: Comma-separated list of additional TCP or UDP ports
# (e.g., 9090, 53/udp, 8080/tcp) that should be allowed for *outbound* traffic
# originating from within the container, through the VPN tunnel.
# This does NOT publish these ports from the container to the host.
ADDITIONAL_PORTS=

# ---- NZBGet Server1 Settings ----
# These variables allow you to pre-configure the first news server (Server1) in NZBGet.
# The 02-nzbget-news-server.sh script will apply these to /config/nzbget.conf on startup.
# If a setting already exists, it will be updated; otherwise, it will be added.

# NZBGET_S1_NAME: A recognizable name for the server (e.g., your provider's name).
NZBGET_S1_NAME=Newshosting

# NZBGET_S1_HOST: The hostname or IP address of the news server.
NZBGET_S1_HOST=news.newshosting.com

# NZBGET_S1_PORT: The port number for the news server.
# Common ports: 563 (SSL), 119 (non-SSL), 443 (SSL alternative), 80 (non-SSL alternative)
NZBGET_S1_PORT=563

# NZBGET_S1_USER: Your username for the news server.
NZBGET_S1_USER=your_usenet_username

# NZBGET_S1_PASS: Your password for the news server.
NZBGET_S1_PASS=your_usenet_password

# NZBGET_S1_CONN: The number of connections to establish with this server.
# Start with a moderate number like 10-20, check your provider's limit.
NZBGET_S1_CONN=15

# NZBGET_S1_SSL: Enable or disable SSL encryption for this server ('yes' or 'no').
NZBGET_S1_SSL=yes

# NZBGET_S1_LEVEL: Server priority level (0 for primary, 1 for backup, etc.).
# Lower numbers are higher priority. Set to 0 for your main server.
NZBGET_S1_LEVEL=0

# NZBGET_S1_ENABLED: Enable or disable this server configuration ('yes' or 'no').
# If 'no', Server1.Disabled will be set to 'yes' in nzbget.conf.
NZBGET_S1_ENABLED=yes
