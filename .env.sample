# .env - Docker Run Configuration

# --- VPN Settings ---
# Choose your VPN client: "openvpn" or "wireguard"
VPN_CLIENT=openvpn

# --- OpenVPN Specific (only if VPN_CLIENT=openvpn) ---
# Path to your .ovpn file inside the container (mounted from ./config/openvpn/)
# If left empty, the script will try to use the first .ovpn file found in ./config/openvpn/.
VPN_CONFIG=/config/openvpn/yourvpn.ovpn
# Your OpenVPN username and password.
# These are the primary way to provide credentials.
# Other methods (credential files) are secondary. See "OpenVPN Credential Handling".
VPN_USER=your_openvpn_username
VPN_PASS=your_openvpn_password
# Optional: Additional command-line options for the OpenVPN client.
# VPN_OPTIONS=--inactive 3600 --ping-exit 60

# --- WireGuard Specific (only if VPN_CLIENT=wireguard) ---
# Path to your WireGuard config file inside the container (mounted from ./config/wireguard/)

ENABLE_PRIVOXY=yes

# --- Network & DNS Settings ---
# Optional: Comma-separated list of DNS servers to use (e.g., "1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8").
# If empty and using OpenVPN, attempts to use DNS servers pushed by the VPN provider.
# If still no DNS, falls back to defaults (e.g., 198.18.0.1, 198.18.0.2 for some providers, or common public ones).
# NAME_SERVERS=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8
# Optional: Your LAN network (CIDR notation, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
# Allows access to your local network while VPN is active.
# LAN_NETWORK=192.168.1.0/24
# Optional: Comma-separated list of additional TCP/UDP ports to allow outbound through the VPN.
# E.g., for a script that needs to connect on port 9090:
# ADDITIONAL_PORTS=9090

# --- General Container Settings (from linuxserver.io base) ---
